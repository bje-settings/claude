# claude

Claude Code configuration for the `bje` enterprise: a plugin marketplace today, and eventually a
place to sync Claude rules and settings to other `@bje` repos.

## Plugin marketplace

`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is the marketplace manifest (`name: "bje"`). Plugins live under
`plugins/<plugin-name>/`, each with its own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and are registered as
entries in the marketplace manifest's `plugins` array. See
[plugin-marketplaces docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces.md) and
[plugins-reference docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference.md).

Test locally with `/plugin marketplace add ./path/to/this/repo`, then
`/plugin install <plugin-name>@bje`.

## Rules and settings syncing (future)

Not yet implemented. When added, this section should describe how `.claude/rules/` and
`settings.json` get shared into other `@bje` repos.
