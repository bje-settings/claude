// Real git repositories in known states. This is the port of the pure-git
// half of the gh plugin's Python conftest, deleted at #127. The file and
// line references below point to what `tests/gh/conftest.py`,
// `tests/gh/bin/gh`, and `plugins/gh/scripts/*.py` held at `cd0d515`. This
// file carries more of them than any of its siblings.
//
// Git is not mocked (ADR 001, RFC 001 "The testing seam"). Every fixture
// here is an actual repository with an actual (local, bare) origin. So
// `git fetch`, `git merge --ff-only`, ancestry checks, and worktree
// operations all behave exactly as they do in production. A test checks a
// command that deletes a branch or removes a worktree against what it
// actually did. Nothing here reaches the network.
//
// Two groups are deferred to #127, the port whose tests consume them: the
// package-manager builders (`js_project`, `remote_update_lock`,
// `remote_break_lock`, `remote_drop_lockfile`, `corepack_cache`), and the
// pull-request data (`pr`, `write_prs`, `no_prs`, `many_prs`, `dep_pr`). A
// build before anything consumes them would be a horizontal slice. The
// package-manager builders would also skip on a machine without all three
// managers, which would leave this directory below its own coverage floor
// locally.
