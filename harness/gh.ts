// The in-process `gh` double. It gives one reply registered per endpoint, a
// fail switch per endpoint, and an unhandled endpoint that throws instead
// of returning empty (ADR 001, "The command function is the test seam"). A
// stub binary on PATH cannot give that last property. It is the difference
// between a test that proves a call was made correctly and a test that
// passes because nothing was called.
//
// `GhClient` and its query and result types moved to the root `lib/` at
// #125, where the real client is written against them. This file imports
// them back and re-exports them, so a test reaches the double and the
// interface it implements through one module. What stays here is only what
// does not ship: the double, its reply map, and its fail switch.
//
// Failure is a thrown Error, not a result envelope, for three reasons, and
// the real client in `lib/gh.ts` matches this shape. First, an unregistered
// endpoint must throw anyway, so this keeps one shape for everything that
// goes wrong. Second, an envelope would make every endpoint's return a
// union that every caller must narrow, including callers that do not model
// failure at all. Third, the real client runs `gh` as a child process,
// where a non-zero exit with stderr is exactly an exception.
//
// There is no request log, no call counter, and no call-order assertion
// here, on purpose. A call count is an implementation detail, and a test
// that counts calls would turn a refactor red (ADR 001, RFC 001 "The
// testing seam").

 * The fail switch. Register it in place of an endpoint's reply, and that
 * one endpoint fails with this message.
 *
 * This is a `GhError`, not a plain one, because that is what the real
 * client throws. Round 5's handoff fact 3 makes the whole point: `GhError`
 * carries gh's exit status, so a caller branches on a value, not on prose.
 * A command whose test registered a plain `Error` could never reach its own
 * `error instanceof GhError && error.status === ...` branch. The double
 * would then make the command look covered, while the branch that matters
 * stayed unreachable.
 *
 * `status` defaults to 1, gh's own generic non-zero status. A test that
 * does not care about the number need not name it. The `cause` field holds
 * the message. The real client puts the whole `RunResult` there, and there
 * is no run here, so `cause` carries the one fact there is, instead of
 * `undefined`.
 *
 * `detail` is the message too. On a real failure, `detail` holds gh's own
 * account, without the `gh <argv> failed: ` prefix. A command reads
 * `detail`, not `message`, for its one-line reason. A test writes the
 * message it wants that command to print, so here the two fields hold the
 * same string. A double whose `detail` was empty, or absent, would make a
 * command that reads it look broken, for a reason the real client never
 * produces.
