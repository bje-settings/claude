// One test's private world: a temp directory, a HOME inside it, and an
// environment the test can rewrite. This is the port of the `Sandbox`
// class and the `sandbox` fixture in tests/conftest.py (deleted at #138).
//
// Two deliberate changes from the Python original. First, nothing here
// touches `process.env`. Pytest gives every example its own monkeypatch,
// and undoes it at the end. Vitest runs several test files through one
// worker process, so a mutated `process.env` would outlive the test that
// set it, and reach whatever ran next in that worker. Instead, the
// sandbox hands out an `env` object. The spawn helper and the git builder
// take this object as the child's environment, and a test may edit it
// freely, because no other test can see it.
//
// Second, git's whole environment, and gh's, is held inside the sandbox,
// not left to HOME alone. `sandboxEnv` says why.

// The tools a plugin script may reach for. `pathWithout` links all of
// these into a fresh bin directory, except the ones it is asked to leave

// without a change to the real PATH. Python's `python3` is `node` here. It
// is the interpreter the ported scripts run under, and the one whose
// absence they must survive.
//
// This is `as const` so the names survive as a type. `pathWithout` only
// ever walks this list. If an essential tool were missing from it, the
// list would never test for that tool, and the guarantee below would
// quietly stop holding. `CommonTool` makes that a compile error instead.

 *  repository's own workspace exports it from direnv. Without this fix, a
 *  fixture reads the developer's real global config, while CI reads none.
 *  With `status.showUntrackedFiles = no` and `merge.ff = false` in that
 *  file, two of tests/harness/git.test.ts's own assertions fail locally and pass in CI.
 *
 *  Pointing `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` inside the sandbox restores the plain
 *  meaning of moving HOME, and leaves a test free to write that file
 *  itself. `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM` makes the same argument for the
 *  machine's system config, which sets `init.defaultBranch` on a stock
 *  macOS git. This function uses it, not `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM`, because
 *  Apple's build reads its own system file, whatever that variable names.
 *
 *  This returns a copy, never the object it was given. The point of the
 *  sandbox is that a test cannot change what another test sees. This
 *  function is exported so its own claims can be checked against a base
 *  environment this process does not have.
