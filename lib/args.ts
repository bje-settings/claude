// This file parses arguments. It wraps `node:util`'s `parseArgs` (#125's
// scope line names it). This file writes the wrapper once, instead of in
// each `bin`. RFC 001 decision 3 keeps `bin` a thin adapter with no
// decisions in it. A parse with a return value is also testable without a
// process.
//
// **What this file adds to `parseArgs`, and why each addition has a
// caller.** node answers a bad command line with a thrown `TypeError`. A
// `bin` would have to catch the error and translate it. Here, the answer
// comes back as a `refused` envelope.
//
// A bad flag then exits with code 2, the same code `argparse` uses in the
// scripts this file ports. `choices` is the one piece of `argparse` that
// node has no answer for. `mermaid-url.py`'s `--route` flag is the caller
// that needs it (#126).
//
// **What `parseArguments` deliberately does not add.** It does not add
// positionals. `parseArgs` refuses them, and the refusal travels as an
// envelope. This is what every command but one wants. `parseCommandLine` is
// the widened sibling for the one command that needs positionals
// (`plugins/audit`'s `/audit:context`, #170). Every other caller keeps the
// untested path closed. It does not inherit a positional it never asked
// for.
//
// This file also does not add support for `--help`. Help text is a
// command's own sentence about itself. A command declares a `help` boolean
// and prints its own text. That is one line there, against a text generator
// here that every command would then have to fit.
//
// This file ships. It imports nothing outside the root lib, and nothing
// from node beyond `util`. It stays inside the erasable subset (ADR 001).
