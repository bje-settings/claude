// This file enforces the runtime floor where it is crossed. It does not
// only write the floor down and hope a user obeys it. ADR 001 holds the
// floor in three places: `.npmrc`, `engines.node`, and a CI leg. It
// executes the floor in one place: the guard that every `bin` and every
// hook calls first. The floor is a property of the release, not of this
// process. So the check is a pure function over a version string.
//
// An entry point passes `process.version` to it, and the suite passes the
// versions that ADR 001's spike table records.
//
// **This file imports nothing. That absence is essential.** `import`
// declarations are hoisted, and run before any statement in an entry point
// runs. So a guard with a module graph would load that graph on the very
// runtime it exists to refuse. The sentence a user should read would then
// be a syntax error from inside a dependency, instead.
// `plugins/mermaid/scripts/mermaid.ts` (#126) makes this its one static
// import. It reaches everything else by `await import` after the check.
// `bin/gh-security.ts` does the same, in the SurveyMonkey/skills baseline.
//
// This file ships, so it stays inside the erasable subset (no `enum`, no
// parameter properties, no namespaces). node strips the types; it does not
// compile them (ADR 001, RFC 001 decision 12).
