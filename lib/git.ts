 * These are the options every question below takes. Each one names one
 * repository, and the environment to ask it in.
 *
 * {@link GitOptions} leaves both `cwd` and `env` optional. Here, and in the
 * default `gitOut` uses, the whole object is required. Each question below
 * asks about ONE repository. Neither `cwd` alone nor `env` alone says which
 * one.
 *
 * `cwd` is the obvious half. A call that names no directory would ask about
 * wherever the process happens to sit.
 *
 * `env` is the half that actually matters, and it is required, not
 * optional. `GIT_DIR` outranks both `cwd` and `git -C` for everything the
 * git directory holds. With `GIT_DIR` set, {@link currentBranch} reads the
 * named repository's HEAD. {@link defaultBranch} reads its `origin/HEAD`.
 * {@link hasRef} reads its refs. Each does this whatever directory the call
 * gave.
 *
 * {@link toplevel} is the one exception, and it deserves a closer look.
 * `GIT_DIR` with no `GIT_WORK_TREE` set makes the current directory the top
 * of the work tree. So `rev-parse --show-toplevel` still answers about
 * `cwd`. `GIT_WORK_TREE` is the variable that changes this, and git
 * exports it into a hook's children too.
 *
 * git exports `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_INDEX_FILE` into every child of a hook. A
 * pre-commit hook is one place this test suite runs (`lefthook.yml`). An
 * optional `env` here would be a rule stated in a comment, but never
 * checked. The caller that most needs to pin `env` is the one most likely
 * to leave it out.
 *
 * **This requirement names the environment; it does not scrub it.** `env:
 * process.env` satisfies this type. Inside the hook described above, it
 * still carries `GIT_DIR` at full strength. Nothing in this file strips
 * anything from the environment.
 *
 * Nothing here can. This file calls {@link run} directly, so it has no
 * seam for that. A caller who chose an environment is entitled to the one
 * it chose.
 *
 * What the required field does is put the environment at the call site.
 * There a reader sees which environment is in use, and a reviewer can ask
 * whether it is the right one. Read this as "say which environment", never
 * as "git is safe from `GIT_DIR`".
 *
 * The port's own answer, for a caller with nothing to pin, is
 * `process.env`. Every ported call site inherits it today (`grep GIT_DIR
 * plugins/gh/` finds nothing). If a caller passed `{}` instead, it would
 * drop `HOME` and `PATH` too. Global config discovery and credential
 * helpers would then behave differently. This default is named here so
 * that layers 2 to 4 do not each invent a different one. `lib/README.md`'s
 * "Decisions not taken" section covers the scrubbing helper, and what would
 * bring it back.
 *
 * The four helpers above keep `env` optional on purpose. They are the
 * general escape hatch, and the preflight check that reports on git
 * itself. For those, the ambient environment is sometimes the very thing
 * that callers ask about (`gh-sync-repo.py:65` to `86`). To silently
 * rewrite an environment that a caller chose would be its own defect.
